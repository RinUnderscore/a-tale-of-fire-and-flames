Read about what the developer is up to here!

## Dec 31st 2022 (v0.0.3a)
Hello everyone! It's RinUnderscore here! Last day of the year, pretty exciting! I've finished up some work on the v0.0.3 update called: "Better Dev" Update. This really will be helpful when I add many stuff for local development before I finish up the servers and databasing (which is totally because I want to do things locally and not because I'm too lazy to figure out the databasing issues yet...) I've put an question on: [stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74972543/python-realtime-database-google-firebase-sending-integer-instead-of-json-file) but I'm not sure how long it is going to take. Tomorrow is the New Year, so only a few updates while I chill at the Airport. Hopefully I can fix some issues with the servers then. See you later!
